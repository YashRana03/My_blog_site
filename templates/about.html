        <p>I am robotics engineering student at the Queen Mary University of London.</p>
        <p>Always had a passion for problem-solving and challenging myself. Thus I chose to pursue engineering as it allows me to combine my creativity and passion for science to come up with solutions to real life problems.</p>
        <p>Through my degree I was lucky enough to discover programming which I think is logic at its purest but most importantly it can be easily implemented to make our lives better.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking especially Italian food. Pizza is indeed my life!</p>
